# Prompt optimalization
This repository constains code for bachelor's thesis on the topic of LLM prompt optimalization.
The main focus is on optimalization through evolutionary algorithms.

## Usage
*Run run.py*

As of now only possible using a SLURM job scheduler and a SLURM script on a compute cluster. 
Calls are done with OpenAI API to a VLLM server.

## TODOs
- add CLI
- add ability to run on OpenAI cloud
- add support to run on local GPU with some models
- find other compatible models and add them
